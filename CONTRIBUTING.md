# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution. Convergio is small and opinionated.
Read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) and [CONSTITUTION.md](./CONSTITUTION.md)
before writing code.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Roberdan/convergio
cd convergio
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

The toolchain is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`. Lefthook installs git
hooks (`fmt`, `clippy`, file-size guard, commitlint):

```bash
brew install lefthook && lefthook install   # macOS
# or: go install github.com/evilmartians/lefthook@latest
```

## Workflow

1. Branch off `main`. Use a worktree if you'll have parallel work:
   `git worktree add ../convergio-feature -b feat/short-name main`.
2. Implement + test.
3. Run the local CI bundle before pushing:
   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   RUSTFLAGS="-Dwarnings" cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
   RUSTFLAGS="-Dwarnings" cargo test --workspace
   ```
4. Commit using conventional commits with a crate scope
   (see `commitlint.config.js`):
   ```
   feat(durability): add audit hash chain
   fix(server): return 409 on gate refusal
   docs(repo): expand AGENTS.md request lifecycle section
   ```
5. Open a PR. Fill out all sections of the PR template — Problem,
   Why, What changed, Validation, Impact, **Files touched**. CI
   rejects PRs that don't.

## Merge order and the PR queue

When several PRs are open in parallel, merge in dependency order so
no PR force-pushes someone else's reviewable diff out from under
them. Suggested rules:

- A PR with **zero conflicts** in its `Files touched` manifest can
  merge any time once CI is green and the branch is up-to-date.
- A PR that overlaps another open PR's `Files touched` block waits
  for the other to merge, then **rebases on the new main** before
  its CI runs.
- The most invasive PR (the one rebased on top of every other) goes
  last. Mark it with `Depends on PR #N` lines in `Files touched`.

GitHub merge queue is the long-term automation for this rule —
enable it on `main` via the repository settings page (Settings →
Branches → Branch protection rule for `main` → Require merge queue).
The free public-repo plan supports it. Once enabled, the suggested
merge method stays `Merge commit` (CONSTITUTION § hard-rule:
`allow_squash_merge=false`, `allow_rebase_merge=false` — squash
loses parallel-agent history, rebase rewrites it).

Until merge queue is wired in, the local helper at
`scripts/cleanup-local-branches.sh` keeps the working tree tidy
after each `gh pr merge --delete-branch`.

## Code rules

| Rule | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Max **300 lines** per `*.rs` file | Forces module decomposition; CI-enforced |
| Every `pub` item has a `///` doc comment | Rustdoc + agent legibility |
| Every `lib.rs` opens with `//!` block | Crate purpose + entry-point map |
| No `unwrap()` / `panic!()` in production code | Use `Result` and `thiserror`/`anyhow` |
| Tests for every `pub fn` and every bug fix | Regression protection |
| New gate / new endpoint → ADR | `docs/adr/NNNN-short-title.md` |
| New DB field → migration in same PR | Reviewers reject schema PRs without one |

## Test conventions

- **Unit tests**: inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests {}` in the same file.
- **Integration tests**: in `crates/<name>/tests/`, one feature per file
  (≤200 lines), shared helpers in `tests/common/mod.rs`.
- **E2E tests**: workspace-level `tests/` boot the server in-process.
- **Fixtures**: `crates/<name>/tests/fixtures/` (data) and
  `tests/snapshots/` (insta).
- **Never assert exact counts** for system-wide data — use `>=`. Exact
  counts only for test-scoped data.
- **Never hardcode the version** — use `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`.

## Documentation

- Rustdoc on every `pub` item. Treat `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps`
  as part of the build.
- Per-crate `README.md` synced from `lib.rs` `//!` via `cargo rdme` (run
  `cargo rdme --check` in CI).
- ADRs in `docs/adr/`. Use the MADR template at `docs/adr/0000-template.md`.

### Root/crate alignment process

When a PR changes a crate boundary, public command, HTTP route, daemon
loop, migration range, user-visible copy, or agent protocol surface,
align product memory in the same PR:

1. Update the crate-local `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`
   only for local responsibility, invariants, validation commands, and
   links to root ADRs.
2. Keep canonical ADRs in root `docs/adr/`; do not create crate-local
   ADR forks or duplicate full ADR bodies in crate docs.
3. Update root `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
   `ROADMAP.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md`, and ADRs only when shipped behavior
   or product law changes.
4. Regenerate derived docs:
   ```bash
   cvg docs regenerate --root .
   ./scripts/generate-docs-index.sh
   cvg docs regenerate --check
   ./scripts/generate-docs-index.sh --check
   ```
5. In PR evidence, state which crates changed, whether a public API or
   migration changed, which ADRs apply, and whether the root product
   version is enough or the change needs explicit compatibility notes.

### Versioning policy

Convergio currently has one product version in
`[workspace.package].version`. Internal crates inherit that version
because the repository ships as one daemon/CLI platform. Track per-crate
impact in release notes and PR evidence, not by independently bumping
every crate. Introduce independent crate semver only for crates that are
published or consumed as standalone external APIs. See
ADR-0030 for the release-policy decision.

## Reporting issues

Use GitHub Issues with one of: `bug`, `feature`, `docs`, `question`.
Security issues go through `SECURITY.md` (private disclosure).
