//! `WaveSequenceGate` — refuses `in_progress` claims for tasks in a
//! wave whose predecessor wave is not yet fully complete.
//!
//! Terminal states (`done`, `failed`) do not block subsequent waves:
//! a `failed` task is already off the critical path, and the plan can
//! either retry it (creating a fresh task in the same wave) or accept
//! the failure and move on. Treating `failed` as "still open" would
//! deadlock plans whose wave 1 contained an intentional probe or any
//! permanently-rejected task.
