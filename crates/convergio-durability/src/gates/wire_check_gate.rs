//! `WireCheckGate` — refuses `submitted`/`done` when the agent
//! claims to have wired routes or CLI paths that do not actually
//! exist in the workspace.
//!
//! Sister gate to [`super::NoStubGate`]. Where `NoStubGate` is a
//! regex-only scan over evidence payloads and admits in its own
//! doc-comment that it cannot catch *"the agent claiming a route
//! is mounted when it isn't"*, this gate closes that gap by
//! reading a structured `wire_check` evidence row and verifying
//! every claimed entity actually exists in the workspace tree.
//!
//! ## Evidence shape
//!
//! Agents attach evidence rows of `kind == "wire_check"` whose
//! `payload` is JSON of shape:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "routes":    [{"method": "GET", "path": "/v1/agent-registry/agents"}],
//!   "cli_paths": ["agent list", "plan list"]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Both keys are optional; an empty / missing payload is a silent
//! pass. This gate is **opt-in by design**: agents that do not
//! attach a `wire_check` row are not refused. CONSTITUTION P4
//! discipline + a future `ClaimCheckGate` (F55-B) is responsible
//! for forcing structured wiring claims.
//!
//! ## Heuristic limits
//!
//! The route check is a substring scan for `.route("PATH"` text
//! across `crates/convergio-server/src/routes/**/*.rs`. It cannot
//! detect:
//!
//! - A route declared but never `.merge()`d into the top-level
//!   `Router` (the file exists, the literal exists, but the router
//!   wiring is missing).
//! - A route added inside a `cfg(test)` block.
//!
//! The CLI check is a heuristic substring scan: for the claim
//! `"<top> <sub>"` we confirm
//! `crates/convergio-cli/src/commands/<top>.rs` exists and contains
//! the `<sub>` token (case-insensitive). It cannot detect:
//!
//! - A subcommand variant declared but never matched in the
//!   dispatch `match` arm (the variant exists, the dispatch is
//!   missing).
//! - A subcommand whose impl lives in a sibling helper module
//!   (e.g. `<top>_render.rs`) — but every shipped subcommand keeps
//!   the variant name in `<top>.rs`, which is the file we scan.
//!
//! Closing those structural gaps is the responsibility of the
//! follow-up `ClaimCheckGate` (F55-B). See
//! `crates/convergio-durability/src/gates/no_stub_gate.rs:7-21`
//! for the parent gate's original list of "things regex cannot
//! catch" — this gate handles the second bullet (route claim).
//!
//! ## Environment
//!
//! Workspace root comes from `CONVERGIO_WIRE_CHECK_ROOT`, falling
//! back to `std::env::current_dir()`. If the resolved path does
//! not contain a `crates/` directory, the gate **silently passes**
//! — refusing on a missing workspace would block transitions for
//! every operator whose cwd is not the repo root, including CI
//! environments running the daemon from a packaged binary.
