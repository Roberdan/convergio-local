//! `Thor::validate` — produce a verdict for a plan.
//!
//! v0 only checked evidence shape: every task must be `submitted` or
//! `done`, and every required evidence kind must be attached. Smart
//! Thor (T3.02, ADR-0012 implementation slice) adds a third gate:
//! before promoting `submitted -> done`, run the project's actual
//! pipeline (test suite, build, custom checks) and refuse if it
//! fails. The pipeline command is trusted-local configuration from
//! `CONVERGIO_THOR_PIPELINE_CMD`; never copy it from plans, evidence,
//! agent output, or other untrusted input. When unset, Thor falls back
//! to the v0 evidence-only behaviour for backwards compatibility.
