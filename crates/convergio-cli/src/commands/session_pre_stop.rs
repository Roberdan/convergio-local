//! `cvg session pre-stop` — end-of-session safety net.
//!
//! Stub scaffold for PRD-001 § Artefact 4. The full body is split
//! across the W0b.2 plan as six independent checks. This module owns
//! only the dispatch surface: a `Check` registry, a `PreStopReport`
//! shape, and a runner that walks the registry and prints a
//! per-check verdict. The checks themselves return
//! [`CheckOutcome::NotImplemented`] until their dedicated tasks
//! land.
//!
//! Keeping every check behind the same trait + registry means each
//! follow-up PR adds one file under `session_checks/` and registers
//! it here — no surgery on the dispatch loop, no risk of breaking the
//! command shape mid-rollout.
//!
//! ## Exit codes
//!
//! - `0` — every check passed (or every gap was acknowledged via
//!   `--force`). The agent may detach.
//! - `1` — at least one check produced findings AND `--force` was
//!   not set. The Stop hook should refuse.
