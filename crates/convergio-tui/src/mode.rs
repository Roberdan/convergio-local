//! drill.
//!
//! Split out of [`crate::state`] so the file stays under the
//! 300-line cap. The flow is:
//!
//! 1. The keymap (`crate::keymap::Action::Drill`) tells the event
//!    loop the user pressed Enter.
//! 2. [`crate::state::AppState::drill_target`] inspects the focused
//!    pane + selected row and produces a [`DetailTarget`].
//! 3. [`crate::state::AppState::enter_detail`] flips
//!    [`crate::state::AppState::mode`] to [`AppMode::Detail`] and
//!    pre-fetches whatever extra data the renderer needs.
//! 4. The [`crate::panes::detail`] renderer takes over the body
//!    until the user presses Esc.

/// Top-level UI mode.

/// `Overview` is the default 4-pane dashboard. `Detail` zooms into a

/// with a single full-width panel — the panes header + footer stay so
/// the operator can still see plan counts at a glance.
