# AGENTS.md — convergio-planner

For repo-wide rules see [../../AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).

This crate is the reference planner. It proves the loop; it is not the
final AI planning brain.

## Invariants

- Keep output deterministic and testable.
- Plans/tasks should be small enough for workers to understand.
- Do not embed provider-specific prompts or hosted assumptions.
- Future advanced planners should be capabilities unless they are core
  coordination logic.
